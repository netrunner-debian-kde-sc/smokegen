smokegen (4:4.7.4-0r1) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.

  [ Pino Toscano ]
  * Bump Standards-Version to 3.9.3, no changes required.
  * Bump debhelper build dependency to >= 9, and compat to 9.
  * Do not manually export CXXFLAGS and LDFLAGS now, since compat v9 does
    that already.
  * Update copyright for myself, for last year and the current one.
