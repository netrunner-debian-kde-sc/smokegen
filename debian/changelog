  * Initial release, split from the kdebindings source.

  [ David Palacio ]

    them in this package.

  [ Pino Toscano ]
  * Update the patches:
    - smokegen_load_system_defines.diff: do not define IN_KDEVELOP_PARSER
      and IN_IDE_PARSER, as they are reserved for kdevelop

    - refresh
    - add DEP-3 headers for patches which didn't have them
  * Update rules:
    - pass --list-missing to dh_install

    - small touches to the descriptions
  * Update copyright.
  * Update lintian overrides for smoke-dev-tools.
